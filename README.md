# Matrix Calendar Widget

> **Status: pre-alpha.** This repository is a hard fork of Nordeck's NeoDateFix / `matrix-meetings` project and is being converted into a Matrix-first team calendar backed by CalDAV/Radicale.

The primary product is a responsive Matrix widget for Element and other widget-capable clients. It should let teams manage shared calendars, events, recurrence, attendees, alarms, and calendar collections without falling back to Radicale's generic collection UI. A Matrix bot provides notifications and a command fallback for clients that cannot render widgets.

## Product principles

- **The widget is the product.** Commands are a compatibility fallback, not a parallel UI.
- **CalDAV is canonical.** Radicale remains the source of truth for calendars and iCalendar objects.
- **Create simple collections.** Calendars created by this project are VEVENT-only. Existing mixed collections are tolerated and preserved.
- **Do not surface dead complexity.** VJOURNAL is not a first-class feature. VTODO may become a separate task-list feature later.
- **Preserve interoperability.** Editing an event must not silently discard iCalendar properties the widget does not understand.
- **Matrix identity, not Matrix passwords.** The widget authenticates to our gateway using Matrix widget/OpenID flows. It must never ask users for their Matrix password.
- **Matrix-native notifications.** Reminder delivery uses normal Matrix messages and `m.mentions`, including optional `@room` where permitted.
- **Track MSC4496 without depending on it.** Our domain model should map cleanly to the proposal while it remains unstable.

## Current state

The repository currently contains the pinned NeoDateFix upstream codebase. Its UI, Matrix widget plumbing, recurrence controls, calendar rendering, bot structure, tests, and deployment patterns are valuable starting points, but its meeting-room data model is **not** the target architecture.

Some directory and package names still contain `matrix-meetings` / `@nordeck`. They are intentionally left intact until the dedicated fork-hygiene milestone so renaming does not get mixed with functional work.

## Development

Node.js 22 and Yarn 1.22 are recommended.

```bash
corepack enable
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn ci
yarn dev
```

The inherited code has its own local development requirements; see the existing package READMEs while the fork is being renamed.
